        <p class="mb32">
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you
          can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
          about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
          this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and
          implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not
          currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
          automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
          a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
          future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
          of this Privacy Notice.
